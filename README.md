# What is this app?

<p style='text-align: justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ This web app is a simple workout tracker where you can see a map with your location (provided by an external API) and inside it you can click and add a workout in that position through a form in sidebar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ Then you can edit that workout or delete it. Everything is going to be stores in the local storage of your browser, so when you close it and re open, you can see the stored workout data in the sidebar and the pins inside the map.

&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ You can clone the repository or download the zip folder, and run it into your favorite IDE through live server; or you can click on the Netlify web link to use it directly on your browser:<a target="_blank" href="https://workmapty-vlaicu.netlify.app/" ><b>https://workmapty-vlaicu.netlify.app/</b>
</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ All JavaScript code file is commented to can follow step by step what is written. Also I attache the flowchart and the architecture of the web page.
